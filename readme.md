## Objective
The objective of this notebook is to implement topic modeling using the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus**. It guides through preprocessing the dataset, applying machine learning techniques, and extracting meaningful topics.

## Features
- **Dataset Loading and Exploration**: Inspect and analyze the CMU Movie Summary Corpus for modeling purposes.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- **Topic Modeling**: Implement **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to identify topics and associated keywords.
- **Visualization**: Analyze results with plots showing topic distributions and keyword importance.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation.
- `numpy`: Numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning utilities for vectorization and LDA modeling.
- `nltk` or `spacy`: Natural Language Processing (NLP) utilities for text preprocessing.

### Installation
Install all dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

## Outputs

### Generated Outputs:
- **Extracted Topics**:
  - A list of topics, each represented by a set of top keywords.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar plots or heatmaps representing topic-word distributions.
  - Graphs for topic coherence or other performance metrics.

### Intermediate Outputs:
- Vectorized text representation.
- Tokenized and cleaned text data.

## Key Functions and Code Blocks

### Preprocessing
- **`CountVectorizer`**: Converts text to a sparse matrix of token counts.
- **`TfidfVectorizer`**: Converts text to a TF-IDF representation.

### Modeling
- **`LatentDirichletAllocation`**:
  - **Parameters**:
    - `n_components`: Number of topics.
    - `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations.

### Visualization
- **Custom utility functions for plotting**:
  - Topic-word distributions.
  - Word importance for each topic.

## Dataset Details
- **Name**: CMU Movie Summary Corpus
- **Format**: Text dataset with metadata.
- **Usage**: Cleaned and vectorized for topic modeling.

## Limitations
- Results depend on hyperparameter tuning.
- Dataset preprocessing affects the quality of topics extracted.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other topic modeling techniques like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
- Use coherence scores to evaluate topic quality.
